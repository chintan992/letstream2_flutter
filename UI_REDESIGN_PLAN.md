   - Blur effects
   - Shadow effects
   - Typography styles

2. Implement animations:
   - Scroll transitions
   - Card hover effects
   - Loading animations
   - Hero banner transitions

### Phase 3: Data Integration

1. Update models and services:
   - Add required fields for UI
   - Optimize image loading
   - Add caching support

2. Implement state management:
   - Featured content selection
   - Trending content updates
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

### Phase 4: Polish

1. Add loading states:
   - Shimmer effects
   - Placeholder content
   - Progressive image loading

2. Optimize performance:
   - Image caching
   - Lazy loading
   - Animation performance

## File Structure Changes
